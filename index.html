            Assigned with the task of redesigning an unresponsive website, I
            selected the Bagel Gourmet Café website because of its lack of
            responsiveness and unclear design. Unfortunately, the website is no
            longer accessible by search, but this
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329033832/http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/"
              >link</a
            >
            will allow you to access the page.

          <h2>Finding Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I began by establishing all of my observations of the interface
            based on efficiency, learnability and memorability criteria.

            WebAIM WAVE identified several issues with the website’s
            accessibility across the alerts, errors and features categories. The
            errors category found the page title and language to be missing or
            uninformative and the heading to be empty. Additionally, it
            indicated 12 contrast errors. Meanwhile, the alerts category
            reflected that there were no page regions, a noscript element, very
            small and unlinked underlined text and ten instances of layout
            tables which presents obstacles in screen reader usage. Finally, the
            features category found 19 occurrences of null or empty alternative
            text.
            <br />
            <br />
            I believe this information is pertinent to the assignment and my
            redesigning process because it primarily reflects poor screen reader
            compatibility, a functionality that is integral to improving the
            website’s accessibility and overall design. Overall, the WAVE report
            coincided with my initial observations of the website’s design with
            more clarity on the features I will need to implement.

            Overall, this assignment allowed me explore different design styles
            for a food business. I did run into some challenges when
            implementing the collapsible navigation bar. While I was unable to
            resolve it during this assignment, my mock-ups fully represent my
            intended design. Next steps would be to consider how this revised
            design would be percieved by others and the changes they would
            recommend. While time did not allow this time, I would be curious to
            know how my color selection is perceived. Furthermore, my choice to
            put "Customer Favorites" was fully because I did not have enough
            space to put their entire menu. In terms of implementation, it would
            be interesting which presentation users would prefer: a shorted,
            best-seller list or the entire menu.
